      "it is an art. Here we work through an example to illustrate one way of proceeding.\n",
      "Assignment: Identify and assess the argument in the following passage.\n",
      "We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for\n",
      "an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in\n",
      "the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that not fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their end. Now whatever lacks\n",
      "intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some\n",

      "When you seen an argument like this, your first job is to identify the main conclusion. Unsurprisingly, this will usually come at the end, though many writers will\n",
      "tell you at the start what the conclusion of the argument is going to be. (This is\n",
      "very helpful to the reader, and you should always do it in your own writing.) In this\n",

      "achieve the best result.\n",
      "(2) If a thing always or nearly always acts in a certain way, so as to achieve the\n",

      "is a benefit to the organism as a whole. In general, when we see a natural thing\n",
      "acting in a way that provides a benefit, we infer that its function (or one of its\n",
      "functions) is to provide that benefit. The second premise makes this assumption\n",
      "explicit.\n",
      "When we turn to the next sentence, we have a puzzle. “Hence it is plain that not\n",
      "fortuitously, but designedly, do they achieve their result.” This sentence begins\n",
      "with “hence,” so we naturally assume that it is supposed to be a conclusion supported by what precedes it. If we pursue this interpretation, the argument will\n",
      "look like this:\n",
      "(1) Unintelligent things always or nearly always act in the same way, so as to\n",
      "achieve the best result. [premise]\n",
      "(2) If a thing always or nearly always acts in a certain way, so as to achieve the\n",

      "(3) Therefore, unintelligent things perform a function. [from (1) and (2)]\n",
      "Therefore, unintelligent things perform their functions by design (and not by\n",

      "unclear whether Aquinas means this to be a new premise or an intermediate conclusion supported by what comes before.\n",

      "Taking the second question first, we twenty-first-century philosophers will\n",
      "have doubts about premise (1) — Do most natural things really act so as to achieve\n",
      "the “best result”? — and also about premise (6). The heart of an animal performs\n",
      "a function. Must it have been designed by an intelligent being for that purpose?\n",
      "Certainly not; natural selection can do the job even if no intelligence is involved.\n",
      "So the premises of the argument are certainly open to question.\n",
      "But even if we waive this objection and suppose that the premises are true,\n",
      "there is a further problem. The conclusion (7) claims that there is a single intelligent being that ensures that natural things perform their functions. But the\n",
      "premises only require that each natural thing be directed toward its end by some\n",
      "intelligent being or other. To see the difference, note that it is one thing to say that\n",
      "every clock has a designer, and another to say that there is a single master-designer who is responsible for every clock. This means that we can accept Aquinas’s premises and much of his reasoning without accepting his main conclusion.\n",
